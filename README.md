# shorten-shopping-urls
A userscript that adds a button to certain shopping websites that shorten the url to get rid of everything past the "?".

## Install
[Click here](https://github.com/katzerax/shorten-shopping-urls/raw/main/shorten-shopping-urls.user.js) to open raw. Should automatically open tampermonkey, which is what I use.
